# Rock, Paper, Scissors game

A project built as part of [Founders and Coders'](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) workshop on [building a feature](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/application/feature/).

## User journey

As a user, I'd like to play Rock, Paper and Scissors against a computer.

### User stories

- As a user, I can choose an option (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) for my move
- As a user, I can see the choice the computer has made
- As a user, I can see the outcome of the game

## Where the project is at now

- We've written out our main steps
- We got our elements from the page
- Our logic isn't complete for calculating who won the game
- An output will be displayed once the game is complete - only if it is a tie
- Choosing a move starts the game
